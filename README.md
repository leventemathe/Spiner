# Spiner
Spiner is a simple Spine calculator for iOS.  
It supports wooden and carbon arrows for recurve bows and longbows.  
Simply fill in your arrow type, your bow's draw weight (at 28 inches) and draw length, then press the button.

Note that the calculator is only supposed to be a starting point, the perfect spine for an arrow depends on many things, so make sure you try it out and make adjustments as necessary.
